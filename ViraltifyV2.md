## üé® Design System Foundation

### Color Palette Philosophy
We'll build a sophisticated, professional design system that conveys trust and innovation:

**Primary Colors:**
- **Primary Blue**: The main brand color for CTAs, links, and primary actions
- **Primary Dark**: Darker variant for hover states and emphasis
- **Primary Light**: Lighter variant for backgrounds and subtle highlights

**Semantic Colors:**
- **Success Green**: For positive metrics, completed tasks, and success states
- **Warning Orange**: For alerts, pending states, and important notices
- **Error Red**: For errors, failed operations, and critical warnings
- **Info Blue**: For informational content and neutral highlights

**Neutral Palette:**
- **Background**: Pure white for main content areas
- **Surface**: Light gray for cards and elevated surfaces
- **Border**: Subtle gray for dividers and borders
- **Text Primary**: Near-black for main content
- **Text Secondary**: Medium gray for supporting text
- **Text Muted**: Light gray for placeholder and meta text

### Typography Hierarchy
We'll use a systematic approach to typography that ensures readability and visual hierarchy:

**Font Family:**
- Primary: Inter (modern, clean, highly readable)
- Monospace: JetBrains Mono (for code, metrics, and technical data)

**Scale System:**
- **Heading 1**: 48px - For main page titles and hero sections
- **Heading 2**: 36px - For section headers and major divisions
- **Heading 3**: 24px - For subsection headers and card titles
- **Heading 4**: 20px - For component headers and important labels
- **Body Large**: 18px - For important body text and descriptions
- **Body**: 16px - Standard body text and most content
- **Body Small**: 14px - For secondary information and metadata
- **Caption**: 12px - For very small text, timestamps, and micro-copy

**Font Weights:**
- **Light (300)**: For large headings where we want elegance
- **Regular (400)**: Standard body text
- **Medium (500)**: For emphasis and important information
- **Semibold (600)**: For headings and strong emphasis
- **Bold (700)**: For very strong emphasis and brand elements

### Spacing System
Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm and improves user experience:

**Base Unit**: 4px (all spacing should be multiples of 4)

**Spacing Scale:**
- **xs**: 4px - Tiny gaps between closely related elements
- **sm**: 8px - Small spacing within components
- **md**: 16px - Standard spacing between elements
- **lg**: 24px - Larger spacing between sections
- **xl**: 32px - Major spacing between page sections
- **2xl**: 48px - Large gaps between major components
- **3xl**: 64px - Extra large spacing for hero sections

### Component Design Principles

**Cards:**
- Subtle shadows for depth without being heavy
- Rounded corners (8px) for modern feel
- Clear hierarchy with proper spacing
- Hover states that provide feedback

**Buttons:**
- Clear visual hierarchy (primary, secondary, ghost)
- Consistent padding and sizing
- Proper focus and hover states
- Loading states for async operations

**Forms:**
- Clear labeling and error states
- Consistent input styling
- Logical grouping with proper spacing
- Validation feedback that's helpful, not punitive
