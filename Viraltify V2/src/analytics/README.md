# 📊 Analytics Module

The Analytics module provides deep insights into scraped content, allowing users to examine performance metrics, identify trends, and make data-driven content decisions.

## 📋 Overview

The Analytics dashboard serves as the analytical hub where users can:
- View detailed metrics for all scraped content
- Sort and filter by performance indicators
- Preview videos with embedded players
- Analyze engagement patterns and trends
- Send promising content to the CRM workflow

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Data Density with Clarity**: Present comprehensive metrics without overwhelming users. Use progressive disclosure to show summary data first, with detailed views available on demand.

**Performance Focus**: Highlight the metrics that matter most for viral content - engagement rates, growth patterns, and virality indicators.

**Actionable Insights**: Every piece of data should lead to a clear next action, whether that's deeper analysis or moving content to CRM.
